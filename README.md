# VoteBox

A simple JavaFX-based voting system application designed to be
deployed onto on-premises voting computers.

## Compiling

To compile this project, you can use the included Gradle wrapper
by using the `./gradlew` or `./gradlew.bat` utilities.

```shell
$ ./gradlew run
```

## Motivation

This application has been built to fulfill the needs of both
coursework assignments for my Object-Oriented Programming module
at University. Not sure what other reasons I would have to make
such a political tool.
